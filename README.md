# Edit Guide

Hi McKenzie! This is the code of your website, it's all yours and you can do with it whatever you want. Try not to break anything
## Rules

1. Do not remove the (" ") from any text. They are for the code to work
2. Do not touch any symbol or "strange text", if it is there is for something
3. If you want to change anything in the source code (any file other than `content.json`), make sure you know what you are doing and the risks involved. 

## Editing the content of your page is very easy

1. In the File explorer of github find the `content.json` file
2. Press the edit button located in the upper right corner next (The one with a pencil as an icon)
3. Find the page and section you want to edit
4. Edit the text and press `Commit Changes` Button
